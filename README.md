# FSAtoManimCode
# Explanation of Finite State Autometa Code

This code is designed to visualize finite state automata with a maximum of four states. It requires the input string to be provided in the terminal.

- **Initial State**: Represented by a yellow circle.
- **Final State**: Represented by a blue circle.

To use this code:
1. Ensure your finite state machine has a maximum of four states.
2. Provide the string you want to check in the terminal.
3. Follow the on-screen visualization to see the transitions and final state.

This code is designed to be user-friendly and provides a visual representation of finite state machines for easier understanding and analysis.


1. The code defines a class `FSA` (Finite State Automaton) to represent a finite state machine with states, input symbols, transition function, initial state, and final states.
2. It includes a method `print_to_manim` that takes user input for an input string, simulates the FSA using the transition function, and generates Manim code to visualize the FSA's animation.
3. The `print_to_manim` method creates a Manim scene `DrawFSA` with text annotations and circles representing states in the FSA.
4. It generates circle positions based on the number of states and assigns colors to initial states (yellow), final states (blue), and regular states (white).
5. The method creates arrows between states based on transitions defined in the FSA's transition function, adding labels to represent input symbols.
6. It handles different cases for the layout and direction of arrows based on the FSA's structure, including curved arrows and straight arrows with appropriate shifts and labels.
7. The code uses Manim's `Circle`, `Arrow`, `CurvedArrow`, `Text`, `Write`, and `FadeOut` functions to create and animate elements in the scene.
8. It checks if the input string is accepted or not by the FSA and changes the fill color of circles accordingly (green for accepted, red for not accepted).
9. The generated Manim code includes animations for displaying text, circles, arrows, and labels, with appropriate delays (`self.wait`) for visualization.
10. Finally, the code saves the generated Manim code to a Python file named `manim_fsa.py` for further execution and rendering of the FSA animation.


# Installation Guide for Manim Community Edition (ManimCE)

Manim is a community-maintained open-source Python library used for creating mathematical animations. It was originally developed by Grant Sanderson, also known as 3Blue1Brown, to produce educational videos on YouTube. Manim allows users to visualize complex mathematical concepts and equations through animations. Below are simplified steps to install Manim on Windows using the Chocolatey package manager.

## Installation Steps

1. **Open PowerShell:**
   To begin the installation process, open PowerShell in Run as Administrator mode. PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language provided by Microsoft.

2. **Check Execution Policy:**
   Run the following command to check the current Execution Policy:
   ```
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

3. **Adjust Execution Policy:**
   If the Execution Policy is set to "Restricted," adjust it to allow the installation of Chocolatey. Run the following command to set the Execution Policy to "Bypass" for the current session:
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
   ```
   PowerShell will prompt you to confirm the change. Type 'Y' and press Enter to proceed.

4. **Install Chocolatey:**
   Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that simplifies software installation. Run the following command to install Chocolatey:
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```
   This command sets the Execution Policy, adjusts security protocols, and initiates the Chocolatey installation process.

5. **Verify Chocolatey Installation:**
   After Chocolatey is installed, verify the installation by checking the Chocolatey version:
   ```
   choco
   ```

6. **Install Manim:**
   Use Chocolatey to install Manim Community Edition. Run the following command:
   ```
   choco install manimce
   ```
   During the installation, accept the terms and conditions by typing 'Y' and pressing Enter.

7. **Verify Manim Installation:**
   After installation, verify that Manim is installed correctly:
   ```
   manim
   ```
   If installed successfully, you'll see the available command-line options for using Manim.

## Additional Configuration

- Ensure that "Python 3" is installed on your system, as Manim is a Python library.
- Optionally, consider installing the "manimsideview" extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to enhance your development experience.

#VisualStudio to run *manim*

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. **Open VS Code:**
   Launch VS Code after installation.

3. **Install Extensions:**
   - Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Python" and install the extension by Microsoft.
   - Search for "Manim Side View" and install the extension by Manim Community.

4. **Set Up Python Environment:**
   - Create a new folder for your Manim project and open it in VS Code.
   - Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Select the Python 3 interpreter in VS Code (bottom-left corner).

5. **Install Manim:**
   - Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).
   - Run `choco install manimce` to install Manim using Chocolatey.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

6. **Run Manim Code:**
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) in your project folder.
   - Write your Manim code in this file.
   - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).
   - Navigate to your project folder and run `manim -pql main.py YourSceneName`.
   - Replace `YourSceneName` with your scene's name.
